# Facial Landmark Detection

This project is about defining and training a convolutional neural network to perform facial keypoint detection, and using computer vision techniques to transform images of faces.
Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking,facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition.

The code presented here should be able to look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face. Some examples of these keypoints are pictured below.
